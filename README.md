The overall scope of my research focuses on the formation, signaling and metabolism of bioactive fatty acids in lung and airway disease. For the last 10 years my lab has investigated electrophilic fatty acid signaling of both endogenously formed bioactive fatty acids and the pharmacological use of these mediators in asthma. Electrophilic fatty acids include nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FA) and oxo-fatty acids that contain either nitrogen dioxide, an α, β-unsaturated ketone or an epoxide group. These lipid mediators pleiotropically signal through the formation of Michael addition adducts with reactive nucleophilic cysteines found in redox regulatory transcription factors and enzymes to attenuate inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. NO2-FA modulate energy substrate utilization in innate immune cells to suppress intermediary metabolite signaling that promotes a pro-inflammatory polarization state. Because of the salubrious nature by which NO2-FA modulate redox signaling pathways associated with metabolism and inflammation, we are utilizing them to attune the systemic metabolic dysregulation that contributes to the pathology of obesity-associated asthma.
